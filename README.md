Hello! My name is Kevin, and I am a second-year game design student. I am a big gamer - like most other game dev students - and my favorite game at the moment is Puyo Puyo Tetris. I love discovering and practicing the intricate mechanics to what I previously thought was a simple game, and I enjoy being able to see a direct improvement in my skills as I play the game more.
