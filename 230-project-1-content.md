Best of the West is a high-stakes shooter game mimimicking the high noon duels of the 19th century. Reaction time is key, as many features of the game happen in the blink of an eye.  

The game is a nontraditional shooter game playable on any device. The design will consist of cartoonish art, realistic sound effects, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly playing on loop in the background.  

In this game, play as a western cowboy with a hot trigger finger for outlaws. Participate in the fight of good versus evil in duels, or work on your aim against glass bottles in practice mode.  

Ideally, this game will work with a mouse on PC as well as touch for mobile. The game can be taught with a single instruction page: wait for the signal, then tap or click on the target as fast as possible.
